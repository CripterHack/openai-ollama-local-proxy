# Utility: Transformers

[src/utils/transformers.js](mdc:src/utils/transformers.js) provides utility functions to convert between OpenAI and Ollama API formats:

- `transformOpenAIRequestToOllama` converts OpenAI chat completion requests to the format expected by Ollama, including prompt construction and options.
- `transformOllamaResponseToOpenAI` converts Ollama responses back to OpenAI-compatible format, including token usage estimation.
- Used by [src/controllers/chatCompletions.js](mdc:src/controllers/chatCompletions.js) to ensure compatibility between APIs.
