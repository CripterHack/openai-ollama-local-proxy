# OpenAI-Ollama Local Proxy: MVP Enhancement Guide

This guide outlines a staged path to evolve your proxy into a robust, feature-rich, and production-ready tool. Each stage builds on the previous, with clear priorities and technical notes.

---

## **Stage 1: Core API Expansion (Compatibility MVP)**

### **Goals:**
- Support more OpenAI endpoints for broader client compatibility.
- Lay groundwork for future features.

### **Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement `/v1/completions` endpoint (text completions, not chat).
- [ ] Implement `/v1/embeddings` endpoint (vector embeddings).
- [ ] Implement `/v1/models` endpoint (list available Ollama models in OpenAI format).
- [ ] Add OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation for all endpoints.

### **Technical Notes:**
- Reuse and adapt the chat completion logic for new endpoints.
- Use Ollama's API for model listing and embeddings.
- Use [swagger-jsdoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-jsdoc) and [swagger-ui-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express) for docs.

---

## **Stage 2: Developer Experience & Usability**

### **Goals:**
- Make the proxy easier to use, debug, and extend.

### **Tasks:**
- [ ] Add a `/v1/health` endpoint for health checks.
- [ ] Add request/response logging with log rotation.
- [ ] Add a simple admin dashboard (web UI) for monitoring requests, errors, and model usage.
- [ ] Add hot reloading for config (e.g., using [node-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config) or similar).

### **Technical Notes:**
- Use [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) or [pino](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pino) for advanced logging.
- Use [express-status-monitor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-status-monitor) for a quick dashboard.

---

## **Stage 3: Security & Realism**

### **Goals:**
- Simulate production OpenAI environments and secure the proxy.

### **Tasks:**
- [ ] Add optional API key emulation (require API keys, validate format, reject unauthorized requests).
- [ ] Add rate limiting and quotas per API key or IP (use [express-rate-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit)).
- [ ] Integrate with mkcert or Let's Encrypt for easier local HTTPS certificate management.
- [ ] Add error reporting integration (e.g., Sentry).

### **Technical Notes:**
- Store API keys in `.env` or a config file for dev.
- Use [express-rate-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit) for throttling.
- Use [@sentry/node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/node) for error tracking.

---

## **Stage 4: Performance & Scalability**

### **Goals:**
- Make the proxy robust for heavy local development or team use.

### **Tasks:**
- [ ] Add Node.js clustering (multi-core support).
- [ ] Add a caching layer for repeated requests (use [node-cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cache) or Redis).
- [ ] Add E2E tests with Docker Compose (spin up proxy + Ollama + test client).

### **Technical Notes:**
- Use Node's built-in `cluster` module or [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2).
- Use [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) for E2E tests.

---

## **Stage 5: Community & Extensibility**

### **Goals:**
- Make the proxy easy to extend and configure for different use cases.

### **Tasks:**
- [ ] Add a plugin system for custom request/response transformers or middleware.
- [ ] Add a web UI for editing config and managing models.
- [ ] Add support for routing to multiple LLM backends (Ollama, LM Studio, HuggingFace, etc.).
- [ ] Add tutorials, recipes, and troubleshooting docs.

### **Technical Notes:**
- Use a simple plugin loader (e.g., load JS files from a `plugins/` directory).
- Use [react-admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/) or similar for the admin/config UI.

---

## **Ongoing: Testing, CI/CD, and Documentation**

- [ ] Enforce code coverage with Jest and CI.
- [ ] Add more integration and E2E tests as new features are added.
- [ ] Keep the README and OpenAPI docs up to date.

---

## **Prioritization & Milestones**

1. **Stage 1**: Core API Expansion (highest impact for compatibility)
2. **Stage 2**: Developer Experience (makes the proxy easier to use and debug)
3. **Stage 3**: Security & Realism (important for team/multi-user dev)
4. **Stage 4**: Performance & Scalability (for heavy or team use)
5. **Stage 5**: Community & Extensibility (for long-term growth)

---

## **How to Use This Guide**
- Tackle one stage at a time; each can be a milestone or release.
- After each stage, update tests, docs, and CI.
- Use the technical notes and suggested npm packages for fast, reliable implementation.
